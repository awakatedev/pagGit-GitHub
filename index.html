        <h1>What is Git?</h1>
        <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers,
         but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. </br>Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflowsclarification needed.
         Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its beginning.</br> Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version-control systems,
         and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.
         Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="what_is_git2">
      <p >Git is a type of version control system used to maintain code.</br>
         To gain a good understanding of why Git is useful, we must first understand the purpose of a version control system. In technology, version control systems are software tools used to track changes to code over time.
         Version control systems (VCS) store a list of all the changes made to code in a database, alongside who made those changes and a description of the changes made. In almost every project—large and small—version control plays a role.
         For teams, having a strong VCS set up is specially important. This is the case for a number of reasons. First, version control systems </br>allow the team to keep track of changes over time, so if something goes wrong they will have a record of the changes and events which lead up to the problem the team is encountering.
         Second, VCS allow a team to store different versions of their project. </br>So, as soon as a new release is ready, it can be stored in a version control platform alongside a name, a description of the release, and any other relevant metadata (such as the name of the author, and so on).
         Even individual developers can make use of version control systems. This is because version control’s primary function is to track code, and even if you are working alone, you will likely still want to keep a record of your code and how it has evolved.</p>

      <b class="git_command" id="command-init">$ git init</b>
          This command will do two things: first, create a .git folder, where the entire database with atomic changes from our project will be saved; and second, create an area that we know as Staging,
          which will temporarily save our files (when we execute a special command for that) and will allow us, later, to save these changes in the repository (also with a special command).</p>

         <p><b class="git_command" id="command-add">$ git add file-folder-mane</b> Helps us move files from untraked or unstaged to staged state. We can use git file-or-folder-name to add individual files and or folders or git add -A to move all files
                                            in our project (both Untrackeds and Unstageds).</p>
         <p><b class="git_command" id="command-reset">$ git reset HEAD</b> Helps us take files out of the staged state to return them to their previous state. If the file came from unstaged, the go back there. and the same was comming from untracked. </p>
         <p><b class="git_command">$ git reset --hard</b> This command allows us to delete all the information we have in the staging area (this removes everything to form permanently).</p>
         <p><b class="git_command">$ git reset --soft</b> This command is friendlier. because it does not absolutely remove the information from the hard disk, only from the staging area and lets us add our changes but from a previous commit.</p>
         <p><b class="git_command" id="command-commit">$ git commit -m "change name"</b> Helps us move files from Unstaged to traked. this is a special occation, the files have been saved or updated in the repository.
                                            Git will ask us to leave a menssage to remember the changes we made and we can use the -m argument to write it.</p>
         <p><b class="git_command" id="command-rm">$ git rm</b> This command deeds one of the following arguments to be successful:
                                            <ul>
                                              <li><b class="git_command">$ git rm --cached</b> Move the files that we indicate to the Untraked state.</li>
                                              <li><b class="git_command">$ git rm --force</b> Delete the files from Git and from te hard disk. Git keeps the record of the existence of the files, so we can recover them if necessary (but we must use more advanced commands).</li>
                                            </ul></p>

      <h2>files status in Git:</h2>

      <p>When we work with Git our files can live and move between 4 different states (when we work with remote repositories it can be more states):</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Tracked files:</b> These are the files that live inside Git, have no pending changes and their latest updates have been saved in the repository thanks to the git add and git commit commands.</li>
          <li><b>Staged files:</b> These are files in Staging. They live inside Git and there is a record of them because they have been affected by the git add command, although not its latest changes. Git already knows about the existence of these latest changes, but they have not yet been definitively saved in the repository because the git commit command has yet to be executed.</li>
          <li><b>Unstaged files:</b> Understand them as “Tracked but Unstaged” files. They are files that live inside Git but have not been affected by the git add command, much less by git commit. Git has a record of these files, but it is out of date, its latest versions are only stored on the hard drive.</li>
          <li><b>Untracked files:</b> These are files that DO NOT live inside Git, only on the hard drive. They have never been affected by git add, so Git has no records of their existence.
                                      Remember that there is a very rare case where files have two states at the same time: staged and untracked. This happens when you save the changes to a file in the Staging area (with the git add command), but before committing to save the changes in the repository you make new changes that have not yet been saved in the Staging area (in Actually, everything still works the same but it's a bit fun).</li>

      <h2>Branches, Merge, and how show commits and compare changes:</h2>
      <p><b class="git_command" id="command-branch">$ git branch branch-name</b>When you start a repository, By defalul you are located in the master branch. This command creates a new branch where you will have a copy of your project and there you can make changes, correct bugs and do experiments, it does not affect your main branch. and if you want to add your changes to the main branch you can do a git merge.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-checkout">$ git checkout branch-name</b>This command is to jump between branches, when you are located in a branch you can see only its state and not that of other branches, to see the changes of another branch and be able to modify it we use the git checkout.
      <b class="git_command" id="command.checkout-id">$ git checkout commit-ID</b>This command let us return in the time. we coan return to wharevwe last vertion of our project, this command is to a form to make news branches and jump betwen thre.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-merge">$ git merge branch-name</b>Whit this command you will can add the changes in a branch in another branch and this make a fussion whit the content to the 2 branches for example add the changes in your master branch.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-show">$ git show commit</b>The git show command shows us the changes that have existed on a file and is very useful to detect when certain changes occurred, what was broken and how we can solve it. But we can be more detailed.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-diff">$ git diff [commit A] [commit B]</b>If we want to see the difference between one version and another, not necessarily all the changes since the creation of the file, we can use the git diff command.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-log">$ git log</b>If we want watch all your commits we could use the git log command and you can get the ID of your commits with this command.
      <b class="git_command" id="command-swich">$ git swich</b>This command let us change to branches.

      <h2>What is a branch and how does a Merge work in Git?</h2>
      <p>Git is a very accurate database with all the changes and growth that our project has had. Commits are the only way to keep track of changes. But branches amplify Git's potential much more.
         All commits are applied on a branch.</br>
         By default, we always start at the master branch (but you can rename it if you don't like it) and create new branches from there to create independent workflows.
         Creating a new branch is about copying a commit (from any branch), passing it elsewhere (to another branch) and continuing the work of a specific part of our project without affecting the main workflow (which continues in the master branch or the main branch).
         Development teams have a standard: Everything in the master branch goes to production, new features, characteristics and experiments go in a "development" branch (to join master when they are finally ready) and issues or errors are they fix on a "hotfix" branch to join master as soon as possible.
         Creating a new branch is known as Checkout. Joining two branches is known as Merge.
         We can create all the branches and commits we want. In fact, we can take advantage of the Git changelog to create branches, bring in old versions of the code, fix them, and combine them again to improve the project.
         Just keep in mind that combining these branches (yes, “merging”) can create conflicts. Some files may be different in both branches. Git is very smart and can try to join these changes automatically, but it doesn't always work. In some cases, we are the ones who must resolve these conflicts "by hand"</p>
